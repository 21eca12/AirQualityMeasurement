# Air Quality Monitoring IoT Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Air Quality Monitoring IoT project developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan course. The project is organized into five phases, each focusing on different aspects of development and implementation.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Project Planning and Research

- Define project objectives and requirements.
- Research available sensors and IoT platforms.
- Develop a project timeline and budget.

### Phase 2: Hardware Setup and Sensor Integration

- Acquire necessary hardware components.
- Set up the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
- Integrate air quality sensors (e.g., PM sensor, CO sensor) with the microcontroller.

### Phase 3: Data Collection and Transmission

- Develop code to collect data from sensors.
- Implement protocols for data transmission (e.g., MQTT, HTTP).
- Test data transmission to ensure reliability and efficiency.

### Phase 4: Data Analysis and Visualization

- Set up a central server or cloud platform to receive sensor data.
- Develop scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- Create dashboards or web interfaces to display real-time and historical data.

### Phase 5: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

- Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire system.
- Optimize code and configurations for performance and scalability.
- Prepare documentation for deployment and maintenance.
- Deploy the air quality monitoring system in the target environment.
